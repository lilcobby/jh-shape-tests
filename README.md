## Description

This program creates an svg logo based on input values gained from terminal prompts.

color, text, text color, and shape can all be defined from user input.

Personally, the coolest part of this project was using a switch function to select an object constructor from inputs.

## Installation

Need to have node js installed as well as inquirer and jest packages.
run an npm install to install all of the node packages required to run this program.

## Usage

open the index.js file in a terminal, run node index, follow the prompts. Once the svg file is created, load it in a browser.

## Contributions

w3schools, me.

## Tests

open shape.test.js in the terminal and run "npm run test"
test checks if correct object is created from the prompts.
